## Thesis

In this repository you can find the LaTex files needed for generating the pdf of my dissertation. The layout is based on the Maggi Memoir Thesis template:

The file that needs to be compiled is Tesis_DGC.tex. In the associated folder Chapters there is one .tex file for each chapter, including the introduction and the general discussion, and the appendices. I guess you can tell the contents of the folder Figures. Some details of the layout, the packages that need to be loaded, and other details, can be found in the file structure_notrim_small_margins.tex (sorry for the long name!).

I used the bibliography style of a well known journal in ecology, The American Naturalist, with the file amnat.bst. I also append the bib file of my whole reference list, full_library.bib.
